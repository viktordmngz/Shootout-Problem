# Shootout-Problem
Trying to use a simulation for a probability problem. I cannot figure out how to prove it so hopefully I can simulate the problem and work backwards from there

The game:
Three people are lined up in a triangle. These players are named A, B, and C.
A and C are good shooters, hitting their foes 50% of the time.
But B is a great shooter, they hit their foes 75% of the time.

The three players agree to take turns shooting; they are very civil about this duel.
They also agree that A will go first.

If A hits B, B won't be alive to continue so C goes next.
The shots are all independent, meaning the probability of hitting does not change:
A and C will always have a 50% chance of hit while alive, B a 75% chance.
Given this information, what is the probability that A wins?
